          question: "What's the difference between UI and UX design?",
          answer: "UI (User Interface) design focuses on the visual elements users interact withâ€”like buttons, icons, and layout. UX (User Experience) design addresses the entire user journey, including research, wireframing, and testing. We combine both to create interfaces that are both beautiful and functional."
        },
        {
          question: "How do you approach the design process?",
          answer: "We follow a user-centered design process that begins with research to understand your users, business goals, and industry context. We then move through wireframing, prototyping, visual design, and usability testing in an iterative approach, refining designs based on feedback."
        },
        {
          question: "Do you create design systems?",
          answer: "Yes, we create comprehensive design systems with reusable components and clear guidelines that ensure consistency across your digital products and make future development more efficient. This includes typography, color schemes, spacing rules, and component libraries."
        },
        {
          question: "How do you ensure designs are accessible?",
          answer: "We design with accessibility in mind from the beginning, following WCAG guidelines for color contrast, text size, navigation, and screen reader compatibility. We also conduct accessibility audits to ensure all users, including those with disabilities, can use your product effectively."
        },
        {
          question: "Can you work with our development team?",
          answer: "Absolutely. We collaborate closely with development teams to ensure designs are implemented accurately. We provide detailed specifications, assets, and documentation, and can assist during the development phase to address any design-related questions."
